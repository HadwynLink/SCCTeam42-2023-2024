This is the compilation of all the code for Team 42's project during the Supercomputing Challenge 2023-2024. 
If you want to check out the frontend of our project, either download the standalone.exe and run that, or download the folder "Frontend Simulation, uncompressed", unzip the folder, and run "Radiation Frontend.exe" if the standalone executable does not work.
All other folders contain the code for demonstration purposes, and do not run individually.
